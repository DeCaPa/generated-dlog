      <description>Premise Searching for meaningful information from blockchain data and decentralized storage (IPFS) is extremely difficult. To begin, data stored on a blockchain is transactional and based sequentially upon when the transaction was added to the chain. A traditional database is relational but blockchains are not. Imagine having to search thru every block beginning with the genesis block to the most recent to find what you are looking for. It will not only be slow, but the amount of processing and transformation into something meaningful is cumbersome and requires that you do it all yourself.</description>
