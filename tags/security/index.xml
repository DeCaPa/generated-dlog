      <description>Shift Left? Shift Everywhere! The notion of shifting left has been a best practice by application security practitioners, devOps engineers, and application security tool vendors for a long time. Shift Left is a term used to reflect the practice of identifying weaknesses and vulnerabilities as quickly as possible, while minimizing development friction. The advantage to identifying issues early on, results in better security, agility, and cost efficiencies.
Left Until You Cannot Shift Left is accomplished by utilizing secure code analysis tools, trained secure developers, and automation to provide feedback at the speed of DevOps.</description>

      <description>Introduction Q: Is it possible for a commercial enterprise to implement an application security program with only opensource tools?
A: tl;dr – Yes, it’s possible!
Oftentimes organizations face a lack of funding to implement a commercial, “turnkey” application security solution. As an alternative, it might be worth evaluating opensource solutions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note the term opensource comes with the understanding that many “free” application security tools are not “free” for commercial use.</description>

      <description>What is an NFT? NFT stands for NonFungible Token. Think of it as a digital record which has been minted (created) on a blockchain. Meaning, the file represents &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; that has been recorded on a blockchain. It is very unlikely the NFT itself is stored on a blockchain, rather the transaction details and a reference to the actual NFT location are stored on the blockchain.
There are many potential &amp;ldquo;gotcha&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; associated with NFT&amp;rsquo;s.</description>
